# Finite Element Status Design Guide

This guide outlines the process of designing a finite element status system, covering status determination, condition changes, and actions after condition changes.

## 1. Determining the Number of States

To determine how many states your finite element system should have:

1. Identify the core elements of your system.
2. List all possible conditions these elements can be in.
3. Group similar conditions if possible to keep the number of states manageable.
4. Ensure each state is distinct and meaningful.

Example: For a traffic light system, you might have states like "Green", "Yellow", "Red", and possibly "Flashing Red" for emergencies.

## 2. Preparing Status Change Conditions

To prepare conditions for state changes:

1. For each state, list all possible events that could trigger a change.
2. Define the specific conditions under which each event would cause a state transition.
3. Create a state transition matrix or diagram to visualize all possible transitions.

Example: In the traffic light system:
- Green to Yellow: Timer reaches preset duration
- Yellow to Red: Short timer expires
- Red to Green: Timer expires and no emergency condition exists

## 3. Designing Actions After Condition Changes

To design actions that occur after a condition change:

1. For each state transition, list the actions that need to occur.
2. Prioritize these actions if multiple need to happen in sequence.
3. Consider any side effects or cascading events that might be triggered.
4. Design error handling for unexpected conditions.

Example: When transitioning from Red to Green in the traffic light system:
1. Turn off the red light
2. Turn on the green light
3. Reset the timer for the green light duration
4. Log the state change

## Method for Implementing Finite Element Status

Here's a step-by-step method to implement a finite element status system:

1. Define States:
   ```python
   states = ["State1", "State2", "State3"]
   ```

2. Define Transition Conditions:
   ```python
   transition_conditions = {
       "State1": {"Event1": "State2", "Event2": "State3"},
       "State2": {"Event3": "State1", "Event4": "State3"},
       "State3": {"Event5": "State1", "Event6": "State2"}
   }
   ```

3. Implement State Actions:
   ```python
   def perform_action(current_state, next_state):
       if current_state == "State1" and next_state == "State2":
           # Perform action for State1 to State2 transition
           pass
       # Define other transition actions
   ```

4. Create State Machine:
   ```python
   class FiniteStateMachine:
       def __init__(self, initial_state):
           self.current_state = initial_state

       def trigger_event(self, event):
           if event in transition_conditions[self.current_state]:
               next_state = transition_conditions[self.current_state][event]
               perform_action(self.current_state, next_state)
               self.current_state = next_state
               print(f"Transitioned to {self.current_state}")
           else:
               print(f"Event {event} not valid for current state {self.current_state}")
   ```

5. Use the State Machine:
   ```python
   fsm = FiniteStateMachine("State1")
   fsm.trigger_event("Event1")  # Should transition to State2
   fsm.trigger_event("Event3")  # Should transition to State1
   fsm.trigger_event("Event5")  # Should print an error message
   ```

By following this method, you can create a flexible and maintainable finite element status system that clearly defines states, transition conditions, and actions.
